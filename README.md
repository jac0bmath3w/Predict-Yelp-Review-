# Predict-Yelp-Review-
Yelp reviews are used to train a classifier using keras libraries to predict if a review is positive (4 or 5) or negative (1, 2 or 3)

When the ANN is used, I got an accuracy of 82% on the test set. No tuning was done. 

When a Multinomial NB is done, I got a 58% accuracy. 

Also, I got a better accuracy when I used a bag of words input rather than the ttfidf transformation.
